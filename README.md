# Realign: Evaluation & Experimentation Framework for AI Applications

![realign_banner.png](site/realign_banner.png)

`realign` is an evaluation and experimentation framework for building reliable AI applications through test-driven development. Test and evaluate agent architectures, RAG systems, prompts, and models across hundreds of scenarios specific to your use-case.



### ðŸŽ¯ With Realign, you can:

- **Build reliable AI agents** and RAG systems with test suites tailored to your use-case
- **Evaluate quality** by simulating your agents over hundreds of scenarios in parallel
- **Experiment with 100+ models,** prompts, and other parameters to find optimal configurations
- **Detect regressions** by integrating test suites with your CI/CD pipeline
- **Track experiments** with HoneyHive for cloud-scale analytics, visualization, and reproducibility

### ðŸ’¡Â Whatâ€™s unique about Realign

- **YAML-Driven DX:** Cleanly manage your agents, evaluator prompts, datasets, and other parameters using easy-to-read YAML config files
- **Composable Evaluators:** Automatically evaluate quality using our library of 25+ pre-built evaluators, or create your own using composable building blocks
- **Blazing Fast Execution:** Speed up your evaluations with parallel processing and async capabilities, with built-in modules for smart rate limiting
- **Statistical Rigor:** Use statistics to test hypotheses and sweep hyperparameters to optimize performance

# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to help make Realign better. This guide will help you get started. If you have any questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vqctGpqA97) or through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/honeyhiveai/realign/issues/new).

### Project Overview

Realign is an MIT licensed testing framework for multi-turn AI applications. It simulates user interactions, evaluates AI performance, and generates adverserial test cases.

We particularly welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Bug fixes

- Documentation updates, including examples and guides

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/realign.git

cd realign
```

3. Set up your development environment:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. We try to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This is not required for feature branches. We merge all PRs into `main` with a squash merge and a conventional commit message.

3. Push your branch to your fork:

```sh
git push origin your-branch-name
```

4. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the promptfoo repository.

When opening a pull request:

- Keep changes small and focused. Avoid mixing refactors with new features.

- Ensure test coverage for new code or bug fixes.

- Provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the problem or test the new feature.

- Be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make changes if requested.

- Ensure your tests are passing and your code is properly linted.

Don't hesitate to ask for help. We're here to support you. If you're worried about whether your PR will be accepted, please talk to us first (see [Getting Help](#getting-help)).
